# Crypted chat
This application is the result of a challenge to develop a program entirely on mobile.
I choosed to train my network and cryptography skill with a simple peer to peer crypted message box.

You can host/join rooms and send messages crypted with the RSA encryption method (asymetric keys).

## Warning
This is only a training project made 100% on a phone, the code is not clean and it may have problems/security issues: the goal was only to have a functionnal prototype.

## Made with Applications
- Termux (Unix environment)
  - git (project versionning)
  - tmux (Shared screen for tests server/clients)
- Pydroid 3 (python IDE)
  - socket (network)
  - thread (clients and server threads)
  - kivy (GUI)
